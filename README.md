Project	Summary
This project is an extension of the Assignment 6.  The user will input a file name of a list of movies, which is provided, and the program will read this list and convert it into a binary search tree. The program will allow you to search and edit the tree to
simulate the process of renting a movie, returning a movie, or just looking through the movies.  The program allows for mmany functions
such as finding a movie, renting a movie, printing the inventory, deleting movies, counting the total movies, returning a movie, adding a completely new movie, listing based on genre, listing based on dates in which the usar inputs, and finally being able to edit specific parts of the movies info.

How	to	Run
Just download each of the components (the FinalProject.cpp, MovieTree.cpp, MovieTree.h, and the MovieText.txt) and run them through a commandline argument calling in the MovieText.txt

Dependencies
You will only require the list of movies which should be attatched to these files, just remember the name when you input it.

System	Requirements
My program should be able to run on linux, although it has not been tested on other systems.
